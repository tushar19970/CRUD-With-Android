# CRUD-With-Android
I created a CRUD operation with android. 
In this project I used the Java Language, Radio button for choosing options like male or female and SQLite DataBase for storing the data.
For using this app, you have to clone this app on your desktop. 
To run this app in your mobile, you will have to connect  your mobile with Android Studio. 
After connecting the mobile you can run then App will be successfully installed in your mobile.
